    Break down the strategy below into steps for a solver to complete in order to solve the problem. Be creative, not pedantic. Each step should be a clear, concise sentence or short paragraph, inferring a new fact, achieving a goal, or resolving a doubt. 
    
    Ensure the steps follow a logical order, referring to previous steps when useful. Ensure that the result of taking a step is not equivalent to the phrasing of the step: for example, don't include a step "eliminate possibilities A, B and C, ... [for some reason]." because the the action taken in that step will just be equivalent to the step itself. In such situations, the steps should be made more abstract to avoid this issue.
    
    Ensure that the actions taken in each step are justified, for example do not eliminate possibilities unless the reason for their exclusion has been established in a previous step.
    
    Omit steps that ask the solver to do work towards knowledge that is readily apparent. Include only on steps that should lead toward a solution â€” do not consider steps that draw conclusions, nor consider negative outcomes or what to do if a step fails. 
    
    DO NOT YET WORK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM!

        is self-playing or needs a partner.
      evaluation: This strategy is moderately feasible as it hinges on the assumption
        about whether table tennis can be played alone. It could lead to an effective
        deduction about C's involvement if E requires a partner.

      original: Consider whether A might need someone else (possibly C) to continue watching
        TV as implied by 'watching TV with B', and explore the possibility that C was
        part of this activity before B left.
      previous_progress: The phrase 'A is watching TV with B' suggests a shared activity
        between A and B. This implies that A might prefer or require another person to
        watch TV with, especially since the activity is explicitly mentioned as being
        done with B. If A prefers watching TV with someone else, it could imply that C
        was also involved in this activity before B left the room. However, there is no
        explicit mention of C being part of this shared activity.
      recommendation_from_plan_for_obstacles: Avoid assuming activities for C beyond what
        can be inferred from the provided information. Ensure that any assumptions about
        other participants' activities do not override the main focus on A and B watching
        TV together with possible involvement of C.
      result: Given the recommendation, it is important to avoid making unfounded assumptions
        about C's activity. The original strategy suggested exploring if C was part of
        the TV-watching activity based on a preference for company while watching TV.
        However, since there is no direct evidence that A requires someone else to watch
        TV with, and given that C is not mentioned in this context, the adjusted strategy
        will focus on what can be logically inferred from the information provided without
        making assumptions. Thus, it is concluded that based on the given information,
        we cannot definitively determine what C was doing.

    Break down the strategy below into steps for a solver to complete in order to solve the problem. Be creative, not pedantic. Each step should be a clear, concise sentence or short paragraph, inferring a new fact, achieving a goal, or resolving a doubt. 
    
    Ensure the steps follow a logical order, referring to previous steps when useful. Ensure that the result of taking a step is not equivalent to the phrasing of the step: for example, don't include a step "eliminate possibilities A, B and C, ... [for some reason]." because the the action taken in that step will just be equivalent to the step itself. In such situations, the steps should be made more abstract to avoid this issue.
    
    Ensure that the actions taken in each step are justified, for example do not eliminate possibilities unless the reason for their exclusion has been established in a previous step.
    
    Omit steps that ask the solver to do work towards knowledge that is readily apparent. Include only on steps that should lead toward a solution â€” do not consider steps that draw conclusions, nor consider negative outcomes or what to do if a step fails. 
    
    DO NOT YET WORK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM!

      activities, such as E playing table tennis alone or needing a partner, do not override
      the main focus on A and B watching TV together with possible involvement of C. Refrain

      description: Consider whether A might need someone else (possibly C) to continue
        watching TV as implied by 'watching TV with B', and explore the possibility that
        C was part of this activity before B left.
      evaluation: This strategy is moderately feasible and effective. It uses context
        clues ('watchting TV with B') to reasonably infer C's involvement in a shared
        activity.
    strategies:
    - description: Assume that since C is not mentioned as being engaged in a specific
        activity, explore whether the absence of information about C implies C could be
        doing anything, including activities not explicitly stated for others.
      evaluation: This strategy is highly feasible but less effective due to its broadness.
        It suggests multiple possibilities without narrowing down based on given context.
    - description: Analyze if E playing table tennis requires another person and deduce
        if C was possibly involved with E. Consider implications on C's activity if E
        is self-playing or needs a partner.
      evaluation: This strategy is moderately feasible as it hinges on the assumption
        about whether table tennis can be played alone. It could lead to an effective
        deduction about C's involvement if E requires a partner.
    - description: "Determine if the phone call could affect D's sleeping state, leading to a potential inference about Câ€™s role in maintaining quiet conditions for D during B's absence."
      evaluation: This strategy is less feasible as it introduces assumptions not directly
        supported by the given information. The phone call does not necessarily imply
        an impact on D or C's actions.
    - description: Consider whether A might need someone else (possibly C) to continue
        watching TV as implied by 'watching TV with B', and explore the possibility that
        C was part of this activity before B left.
      evaluation: This strategy is moderately feasible and effective. It uses context

    rephrasal: 'Three siblings inherit 90 acres of land from their father, with a will
      stating each should receive an equal share of the land''s value. The land is divided
      into two sections: 60 fertile acres in the north and 30 rocky acres in the south.
      Both sections have the same monetary value due to potential real estate development,
      but the northern section has higher agricultural value. The ambiguity lies in whether
      ''value'' refers to monetary or agricultural worth. How should the land be divided
      among the three siblings?'
    goals:
    - Determine whether 'value' refers to monetary value or agricultural value.
    - Divide the land into three equal shares based on the determined definition of 'value'.
    - Ensure each sibling receives a fair share according to their father's will.
    information:
    - Three siblings - David, Eve, and Frank - inherit 90 acres of land.
    - The northern section consists of 60 fertile acres suitable for farming but difficult
      to develop.
    - The southern section consists of 30 rocky acres unsuitable for farming but prime
      for development.
    - Both sections have the same monetary value per acre due to potential real estate
      development.
    - The agricultural value of the northern land is much higher than that of the southern
      land.
    - The will states each child should receive an equal share of the land's value.

      doubts:
      - Is there a possibility that the will could be interpreted to mean an equal share

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    Situation: Three siblings â€“ David, Eve, and Frank â€“ inherit a piece of land from their late father. The land is 90 acres in total. According to the will, each sibling is supposed to receive an equal share of the land's value.
    
    Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the land:
    
    The northern 60 acres are fertile and highly suitable for farming but difficult to develop for other purposes.
    The southern 30 acres are rocky and unsuitable for farming, but prime for development (e.g., building houses, commercial use).
    Although the monetary value per acre of both the northern and southern sections is the same due to potential real estate development, the agricultural value of the northern land is much higher than the southern land.
    
    The will states that "each child is to receive an equal share of the landâ€™s value." The ambiguity arises because itâ€™s unclear whether "value" refers to monetary value or agricultural value.
    
    Question:
    How should the land be divided among the three siblings?

    Ensure there was an accurate rephrasing of the problem. You are provided with a problem, and a collection of "understanding" about the problem, including a rephrasal of the problem. The rephrasal was made to ensure a deep understanding before solving them. Be clear, concise, and use simple terms. Work to resolve ambiguities. The problem will be solved later looking at both the original and this rephrasing. Provide the final rephrasal in the rephrasal property.

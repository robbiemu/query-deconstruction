- Generating multiple potential strategies.
- Evaluating the feasibility of each strategy.
- Selecting the most promising strategy.

Use the full context of the conversation in these tasks. Use the central theme and the purpose listed in the information to determine how strictly logical vs how exploratory or creative that work towards the solution should be.

These strategies should not prescribe specific determinations. Any logical deduction used in the step must be sound: don't suggest strategies that would only be good in their assumptions were valid without including that the assumptions must be demonstrated. Yet, overall they should be as varied and creative as one would expect based on the characterizations such as theme and purpose listed in the information provided.

Distribute the strategies in the strategies properties, each of them described in their description property; and do not set any of their other properties."""

AVOID GIVING EXAMPLES, instead focus on a list of remedies that may be useful. Do not make suggestions that amount to switching from one strategy to another. Avoid using "if/then" or conditional statements, instead use active voice to prescribe remedies for specific obstacles that may prevent progress.

If these details seem open ended, use abstractions to bring it down to concrete set of remedies. Produce this in paragraph form in the plan_for_obstacles property."""

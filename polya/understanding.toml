rephrase_problem = """You are tasked with rephrasing problems to ensure a deep understanding before solving them. When presented with a problem, follow these steps:

- Restate the problem in clear and simple terms, breaking down complex language or ideas.
- Focus on the core elements and conditions of the problem.
- Ensure that the rephrased version is easy to understand and aligns with the original intent of the problem. Don't express your doubts here, simply rephrase the question.
- Ask yourself: What is the problem really asking for? What conditions must be met?
- Reflect on any ambiguities in the problem statement and clarify them in your rephrasing.
Your goal is to ensure that the problem is fully understood before attempting any solution."""
revise_problem_statement="""You are tasked with ensuring accurate rephrasing of problems. You are provided with a problem, and a collection of "understanding" about the problem, including a rephrasal of the problem. The rephrasal was made to ensure a deep understanding before solving them. Use this workflow:

- Review the current rephrasal to ensure that it is correct. Pay special attention to the terms as these were ambiguities that have been resolved. 
- If the current rephrasing remains accurate, simply return that. 
- If the rephrasing does not fully capture the problem statement, revise it follwing the remaining steps:
    - Restate the problem in clear and simple terms, breaking down complex language or ideas.
    - Focus on the core elements and conditions of the problem.
    - Ensure that the rephrased version is easy to understand and aligns with the original intent of the problem.
    - Ask yourself: What is the problem really asking for? What conditions must be met?
    - Reflect on any ambiguities in the problem statement and clarify them in your rephrasing.
Your goal is to ensure that the problem is fully understood before attempting any solution. Provide the final rephrasal in the rephrasal section."""
identify_goals = """You are tasked with identifying the goals (each independent goal is considered an item) to guide a problem solver in solving the problem. These goals should clarify what needs to be achieved. When presented with a problem, follow these steps:

- Clearly state the primary objective or outcome that the problem is asking to achieve.
- Break down any sub-goals or intermediate steps necessary to reach the main goal.
- Distinguish between what is known (facts, conditions) and what is unknown (what must be solved or determined).
- Ensure the goals are specific and measurable, and not fundamentally an ambiguity in the question, focusing on what success looks like in the context of the problem.
- Consider whether there may be multiple possible goals or solutions, and clarify each one if applicable.
Your objective is to make the goals explicit and clear so that the path toward solving the problem is well-defined.  Your goals must be returned as a list of items in the object."""
revise_goals = """You are tasked with revising a list of goals (each independent goal is considered an item) to ensure that they are relevant, clear and concise. Pay special attention to the terms as these were ambiguities that have been resolved. Use this workflow:

- Start by identifying the goals that were not effected by ambiguity in the newly defined terms: simply preserve these in your response unless they no longer make sense, otherwise set them aside. 
- For the ones set aside, edit as necessary to ensure accuracy with regards to all the understanding gathered, especially the terms. 
- If necessary, create a new goal instead. New goals need to be added, add them following these steps:
    - Clearly state the primary objective or outcome that the problem is asking to achieve.
    - Break down any sub-goals or intermediate steps necessary to reach the main goal.

- Note any constraints or limitations that must be followed (e.g., boundaries, rules, assumptions).
- Organize this information clearly, categorizing relevant data and constraints separately if needed.

- List each ambiguous term or concept without attempting to resolve it yet. Focus only on detecting potential issues with understanding the problem.
- Ensure that each term or concept identified is sufficiently distinct that the user will not sense repetition in the questions or the same underlying ambiguity.
